Choosing a free and open source EMR with a history of success around the world is a great move for those looking to avoid vendor lock-in. As a mature project with a vibrant community, OpenEMR is a great choice for the long term because the provider owns both the data and the software, and cannot be charged for it -- _ever_!

Our group has recently noticed an uptick in cost-sensitive clinicians moving from a [previously freeware EMR](https://ehrintelligence.com/news/practice-fusion-no-longer-offering-free-ehr-system-software) that introduced a new pricing model.

To get started, feel free to explore [our live demo](https://www.open-emr.org/demo/), extensive [documentation](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/OpenEMR_Wiki_Home_Page), and install [options](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/OpenEMR_Downloads) (including your own [cloud](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/AWS_Cloud_Packages_Comparison)).

We support common clinical data imports via our [Care Coordination Module](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Use_the_Carecoordination_module#Import_external_CCDA_file).

There is a robust [self-help](https://community.open-emr.org/) with [live help as well](https://www.open-emr.org/chat). 

But sometimes you need a pro. We have [certified companies](https://open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Professional_Support) to handle anything and everything you need to make using OpenEMR successful in your office.
