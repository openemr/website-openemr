The OpenEMR Foundation is excited to announce a strategic partnership with the Opal Health Informatics Group!

Opal is an award-winning “patient-in-the-loop data” solution that was built and tested at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal. It offers a user-friendly patient portal that is designed to make patients equal members of their own care teams by providing them with real-time access to their health data.

Under this partnership, the two open-source organizations will work together towards a common vision of a world in which every person has access to patient-in-the-loop data and every health care provider has access to high-quality health care information technology.

“The OpenEMR Foundation and community are thrilled to collaborate with Opal in a partnership that promises to significantly enhance patient access to both medical care and health records for individuals around the world. The truly open-source nature of both OpenEMR and Opal will offer clinics a customizable, cost-effective electronic health record (EHR) system and patient portal that is built to adapt, scale, and thrive over the long term.” – Brady Miller, Executive Director of the OpenEMR Foundation.

“By partnering with the OpenEMR Foundation, we will not only enhance our two tried-and-tested technologies with out-of-the-box compatibility, we will also offer the world an affordable open-source health IT solution that can compete with the big EMR vendors and ensure digital sovereignty for both patients and health systems” – John Kildea, director of the Opal Health Informatics Group.
