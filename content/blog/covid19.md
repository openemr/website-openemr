This page contains the latest updates regarding OpenEMR’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic

**[MONDAY 2020-03-16 Update]**    
As the spread of the COVID-19 has reached pandemic levels, the OpenEMR Foundation and community, like so many healthcare organizations and healthcare support systems, remain vigilant of global public health concerns. Given the distributed nature of our community, we anticipate minimal impact to the project in terms of code contribution and community support. Our infrastructure team has contingency plans in place to mitigate any potential downtime to production servers, which include key community applications such as our forums at https://community.open-emr.org as a result of upstream workforce shortages.

Additionally, OpenEMR leadership is taking steps to engage the current user base to assess any immediate EMR functionality that may impede investigation, testing, and reporting. Leadership is closely monitoring latest recommendations from both the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) as well as [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) in crafting tools to aid frontline healthcare workers.

**For OpenEMR Users**, if you are in need of specific forms or reports to more easily comply with reporting requests, you can reach out for assistance on our forums or by emailing [covid19response@open-emr.org](mailto:covid19response@open-emr.org) or by posting on [our special COVID-19 Forum](https://community.open-emr.org/c/covid-19/21). While the OpenEMR community is a passionate group, we are volunteers. This means that we cannot guarantee solutions to every need but will do our best to accommodate needs directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic as expeditiously as possible.

**For Developers**, if you are interested in assisting with rapid development needs to assist frontline staff, please reach out to [covid19response@open-emr.org](mailto:covid19response@open-emr.org?subject=DEVELOPER) with the subject DEVELOPER or posting on our [our special COVID-19 Forum](https://community.open-emr.org/c/covid-19/21).

**For everyone else wanting to assist**, we encourage you to make a [tax-deductible financial donation to OpenEMR](https://www.open-emr.org/donate/) to assist in continued development of key features to improve global health epidemiology as well as making a donation to the [World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate).
Lastly, we encourage everyone to follow their local health agencies recommendations, which include routinely washing your hands for at least 20-seconds.
