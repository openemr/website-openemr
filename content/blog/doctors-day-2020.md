National Doctor’s Day happens every year. This year, however, it comes at a seemingly more appropriate time. As the world faces a pandemic not seen in generations, we want to take a moment to say thank you. It is, quite literally, the least we can do in these times. Physicians everywhere are placing their lives on the line everyday to provide the best care they  can to patients suffering with COVID-19. But we must remember that other diseases have not stopped. Doctors are still caring for heart attacks, cancer, broken bones, and countless other patients who still require our attention. So, if you are a doctor we thank you for your work. We hope you stay safe. We are grateful for your service.
