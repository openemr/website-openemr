# Full Working OpenEMR Demo

We offer 3 fully functional demo installations for you to try out. Some simple configuration has been added for clearer demonstration of OpenEMR, medical billing, accounting, access controls and patient portals. Each demo is reset overnight (PST) so no data is persistent. Note there are 3 identical demos ('Main', 'Alternate', 'Another Alternate') offered in case a demo is down or has been modified. We also offer a [OpenEMR 5.0.0 demo with the most recent patch and a full panel of Development Demos](http://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Development_5.0.0_Demo) (these are demos that are rebuilt daily from most recent development code) where you can test out new features.
