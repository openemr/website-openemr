## Configuration

### Homepage

The homepage can be customized using a variety of parameters in Params.homepage

show_recent_blogs
: Show or hide the Recent Blogs block. Defaults to true

recent_blog_count
: Number of recent blog posts to render. Defaults to 3. Any `featured: true`
post will automatically be included at top of list.

## Layout Helpers

There are several helpful partials that can be used to customize content that 
has specific requirements (such as a section in the homepage). These helpers
are used by designers in specific layouts, not necessarily content writers.

The main benefit of the helpers are to provide layout-based customizations to
the markdown file, allowing flexible separation of content from design. Classes
can be defined in the front matter of the page.

### Contained Split Content Image

Found in `partials/contained/split-content-image.html` this partial allows the
markdown content to be rendered in (by default) a horizontal 50/50 split with 
an image. This partial requires Page.Params.image be set.

Snippet of front matter:

```yml
layout: contained/split-content-image
classes:
  fluid: // Content is wrapped by a fluid container to allow for full-width background
    - container-fluid
  container: // The actual container
    - container
  content_container: // The content column
    - col-sm-12
    - col-md-6
  title: // The <h2> rendering .Title
    - display-3
  content: // The <span> rendering .Content
    - lead
  image_container: // The image column
    - col-sm-12
    - col-md-6
  image: // The <img> rendering .Params.image
    - img-fluid
```
