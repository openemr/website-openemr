# OpenEMR Costs and Support Options

## Overview
OpenEMR is free software and open source, which means you are free to download, use, and customize it to your heart's content!

A huge advantage of open source software is the ability to choose whom will provide you support.
You are NOT locked into one vendor when you choose OpenEMR, and if you don't like your current
model of support or vendor, then it is very easy to change.

Depending on your comfort level, the options for support include:

* Free Support (ie. Doing it yourself).
* Professional Support (Hiring a third party (or employee(s)) to support you).
* Somewhere in between.

## Free Support
The mechanisms of free support by the community include the tools found on this
[website](https://www.open-emr.org). These tools include the extensive documentation
found in the [OpenEMR Project Wiki](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/OpenEMR_Wiki_Home_Page),
the [forums](https://community.open-emr.org/), and the [chat](https://www.open-emr.org/chat).
There are clinics that have gone this route successfully, however, this does require IT
knowledge to ensure security, reliability and adequate backing up of OpenEMR. A real life
documented example of this can be found at the [OpenEMR Complete Installation Tutorial](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/OpenEMR_Complete_Installation_Tutorial).

## Professional Support
A huge advantage of OpenEMR is that you are NOT locked into one vendor. You can choose your vendor,
and you are always free to hire (and fire) whomever you want to support your OpenEMR software.
For example, if you do not like the rates or customer service of your current vendor, then you
can simply fire them and hire another vendor to support your current OpenEMR installation. As a
consumer, this gives you a huge amount of leverage when working with your vendor. The rates that
professionals charge are varied; for example, some charge hourly (usually ranging from $40-$120 per hour depending
on expertise required) and some charge monthly.

### How do I choose a vendor?
There are several things to consider when choosing a vendor/developer
to support OpenEMR. Ensure the vendor/developer has experience with OpenEMR. We maintain a list of
[vendors/developers that specifically support OpenEMR](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Professional_Support).
If you are planning to customize the software (which is very common and another huge advantage of
open source software), then recommend ensuring the vendor/developer has demonstrated competence
in developing code for OpenEMR. We maintain a list of [vendors/developers that are 'Certified OpenEMR Contributors'](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Certified_OpenEMR_Contributor),
whom have demonstrated an ongoing competence in OpenEMR development.

## Somewhere in between
This is where the flexibility of open source shines and you can blaze your own path. For example, you
can choose to do some items with free support, such as forms customization, and other items with
professional support, such as ensuring adequate backups.
