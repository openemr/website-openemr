"OpenEMR is the electronic health record of choice for more than 100,000 medical providers globally, through which over 100 million patients receive care," said Joshua Fischburg, CEO of [Lifemesh](https://lifemesh.ai) Corp. "With our seamless Telehealth integration, Lifemesh and OpenEMR can now provide improved access to care for patients everywhere, in a matter of minutes." Joshua continued, "We are thrilled to partner with OpenEMR and support the global intensification of Digital Health adoption."

“We leveraged modern module tools in OpenEMR to deliver a telehealth product that is intuitive to use for both the provider and patient while also being very easy to install and maintain,“ said Sherwin Gaddis, the lead OpenEMR Developer.

"It is very exciting to have an affordable open source Telehealth offering that is fully integrated with OpenEMR and easy to use," said Brady Miller, an OpenEMR Project Administrator.
