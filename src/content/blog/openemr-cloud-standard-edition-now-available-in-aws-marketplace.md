<!--more-->

[OpenEMR](https://www.open-emr.org), the most popular open-source electronic health record (EHR) and medical practice management solution, has launched [OpenEMR Cloud Standard Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07BBT4C1H) in AWS Marketplace.

"[OpenEMR Cloud Standard](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07BBT4C1H) is the first EHR in the Amazon Marketplace directly aimed at domestic US providers," said Asher Densmore-Lynn, an OpenEMR architect. "We've leaned on Amazon's orchestration services and our own state-of-the-art deployment practices to provide robust, direct answers to HIPAA's challenges."

[OpenEMR Cloud Standard](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07BBT4C1H) is the HIPAA-eligible, Marketplace edition of the [OpenEMR Cloud product line](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/AWS_Cloud_Packages_Comparison). AWS Marketplace is an online store that helps physicians discover and immediately start using the software and services they need to run their practices. AWS serves as a HIPAA Business Associate for HIPAA-covered entities deploying [OpenEMR Standard Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07BBT4C1H).

With no software licensing fees, OpenEMR is the high-value solution in the HIPAA-eligible electronic health records and practice management software category. Now, with Standard edition, OpenEMR is easy to provision and practices can get up and running in just a few clicks. [OpenEMR Cloud Standard Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07BBT4C1H) is also inexpensive to operate, starting at around $70 per month with no-per provider charges.

"I believe that [OpenEMR Cloud Standard Edition](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07BBT4C1H) is a great asset to the OpenEMR community because it enables users to deploy an easy-to-configure, HIPAA-eligible, cloud-based platform," said Sherwin Gaddis, President of Virginia-based [JSE](http://www.openmedpractice.com/), a certified professional support provider of OpenEMR solutions for ambulatory healthcare providers.

"[OpenEMR Cloud Standard](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07BBT4C1H) is cost-effective and a strong contender in a consolidating EMR market. For these reasons, [JSE](http://www.openmedpractice.com/) plans to recommend OpenEMR Standard to all its clients," Sherwin added.
