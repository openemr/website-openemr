Jerry Padgett describes a new quick and easy form builder for your questionnaires/assessments that can be used for both encounter forms and patient portal forms. This new feature allows quick use of already existent standardized LOINC forms in addition to forms built via the NLM Form Builder. <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;" >Because of the poor audio in this video, a chat is also included which transcribes the video.</span>
