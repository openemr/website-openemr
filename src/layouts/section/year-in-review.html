      <h1>Mastering Meaningful Use</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-xl-4 offset-xl-2 text-right">
      <p>
        In February of 2017 OpenEMR achieved full Meaningful Use 2 certification. 
        This was a large step to ensuring the long-term viability of OpenEMR for
        use inside the United States. Of course, such stringent specifications only
        aid to improve our product globally, and we have seen positive outcomes
        both within the U.S. as well as internationally after acheiving this goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Brady Miller, one of the project administrators for OpenEMR estimated
        that the community spent over $200,000 on the certification process, including
        testing with an estimated 80-85 work weeks of time spent on the process.

      <p>
        We know talking about images and containers can be a bit dry, but
        throughout 2017 the community spent <strong>a lot</strong> of time working and discussing
        "dockerizing" OpenEMR - this process marks a significant departure from
        traditional installation processes and offers users a significantly simpler
        installation solution. This lowers the barrier to getting OpenEMR up and
        running for "non-tech" users.

      <p>
      This year, OpenEMR joined with industry-leading Amazon Web Services to
      implement and deliver <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B077G76DWN?qid=1515631968903&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title">OpenEMR Cloud</a>, a cloud service version of OpenEMR available
      to healthcare provider practices and institutions throughout the world. In a few simple steps, healthcare
      providers can leverage the benefits of OpenEMR and AWS by deploying OpenEMR Cloud Full Stack.
      </p>
      <p>Cloud technologies have become a staple in technology and business over the past
      decade, and the healthcare industry is no exception. As a web platform, OpenEMR
      makes a seamless transition to the cloud, enabling many benefits including:
      cutting-edge information security, zero on-site hardware and software, easy deployment, 
      and robust backup and recovery solutions.

        Matthew Vita, a software developer and project administrator for OpenEMR

        to present “Improving Outpatient and Inpatient Care with the OpenEMR Platform”
        at WONCA South Asia Region 2017.</p>
      <p>
        This Kathmandu, Nepal-based conference was primarily focused on General
        Practitioners took place on the 25th and 26th of November. Mr. Vita and Dr. Millet’s
        presentation was given during the oral lectures section. Highlights include
        an overview of the volunteer approach to developing an EMR system, current
        outpatient features and their clinical benefits, as well as development
        plans to introduce more clinical features including inpatient support.

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-xl-4 offset-xl-2 text-right">
      <p>
        OpenEMR was proud to be a contributing sponsor of the 2017 HealthHacks at
        VCU a 24-hour event at Virginia Commonwealth University involving engineering,
        medical, and computer science students coming together to problem solve and
        innovate on current unmet medical needs. OpenEMR was both a sponsor as well
        as a mentor, sending Robert Down, a project administrator, to the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision to sponsor HealthHacks at VCU fell squarely in line with our
        mission to provide high-quality medical solutions to the world. OpenEMR is
        already a long-term, viable solution for low-resource clinics, and our hope
        is to complement our software solutions with the innovations from this event.
        It is our hope that we can continue to develop tools that meet the needs of low-resource
        areas and developing countries to strengthen the healthcare industry throughout
        the world.

        This is just a brief overview of the great things that happened around
        OpenEMR in 2017 - there's <em>no</em> way we could possibly
        showcase everything that happened in our community - it'd take an entire
        year! OpenEMR continues to be a successful project because of our strong
        community and passionate volunteers who give countless hours of their time
        to a cause that hopes to improve global health care. To those volunteers,
        we say <strong>thank you</strong> for everything. Here's to an even better 2018!
